# Make 24!

## Introduction

The game of make 24 involves using only the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication or
division) to compute 24 from four random numbers from 1 to 13. Each of the four numbers must be used EXACTLY once.
For example, if the four numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 4, one way to compute 24 is by: 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24.

In a nutshell, the application will generate 4 random numbers from 1 to 13, and present them to the user. The user will
then apply the arithmetic operations to make 24. If they get stuck solving the problem, they have options to generate
hints and the solution. Once a game is complete, it is saved to game history, which allows players to look back at their 
past games. There will be different modes for different users and occasions, including a recreational mode for casual
play with family and friends and a practice mode for competitive players. Each mode will have different functions, and
is discussed below in user stories. 

I find this project interesting as I enjoy the game of make 24. Something I used to do a lot is play make 24 with 
numbers on car plates when I'm bored on the road. I find it a good way to pass the time as I get rewarded for every game
I solve.
